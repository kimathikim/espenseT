# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Boilerplate

**As a** developer,
**I want** a new Flutter project initialized with Supabase integration,
**so that** I have a foundational structure to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new Flutter project is created and configured for both iOS and Android.
2.  The Supabase Flutter library is added as a dependency.
3.  Configuration for connecting to a Supabase instance (using environment variables for keys) is in place.
4.  The project is checked into a Git repository with a proper .gitignore file.
5.  A basic placeholder screen (e.g., "Welcome") is visible after the splash screen when the app runs.

## Dev Notes

*   Refer to the `docs/architecture.md` for the defined Flutter project structure.
*   Ensure that Supabase keys are stored securely and not hardcoded in the source code.
