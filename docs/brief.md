# Project Brief: M-Pesa Expense Tracker

## Problem Statement

Managing personal finances in Kenya is often a manual and time-consuming process. While M-Pesa provides a convenient way to transact, it lacks built-in tools for tracking spending, categorizing expenses, and gaining insights into financial habits. Users are forced to rely on spreadsheets, pen and paper, or third-party apps that may not be tailored to the local context or offer the desired level of simplicity and automation. This makes it difficult for people to understand where their money is going, manage their budgets effectively, and make informed financial decisions.

## Proposed Solution (Revised)

We are developing a simple, user-friendly mobile application that provides a seamless and automated expense tracking experience, tailored for the Kenyan market. The app will feature:

* **Automatic M-Pesa Sync:** Transactions are automatically imported, eliminating the need for most manual data entry.
* **Immediate & Offline Categorization:** Users can instantly categorize any transaction right after it occurs. The app will fully support offline categorization, allowing users to label expenses on the go and syncing the data automatically when they reconnect.
* **Instant Search:** Users can quickly find any transaction using a powerful search function.
* **Insightful Spending Analysis:** Clear visualizations and reports will help users understand their spending habits and identify areas where they can save money.
* **Secure and Private:** The app will be built on Supabase, a secure and scalable platform, ensuring that user data is always safe.

By providing a simple, automated, and insightful solution with immediate user control, we aim to empower Kenyans to take control of their finances and achieve their financial goals.
